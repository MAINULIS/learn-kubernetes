##Ephemeral containers are a special type of container in Kubernetes designed for temporary, user-initiated actions, primarily for debugging and troubleshooting within an existing Pod.

# Assume pod init-container is already there.
# kubectl debug -it --attach=true -c debugger --image=redhat/ubi9 pod-init-container
