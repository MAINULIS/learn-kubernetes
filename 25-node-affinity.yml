# Node affinity is conceptually similar to nodeSelector, allowing you to constrain which nodes your Pod can be scheduled on based on node labels.
# kubectl label node ip-172-31-21-89.ec2.internal affinity1=one
# kubectl label node ip-172-31-25-174.ec2.internal affinity1=one
# kubectl label node ip-172-31-44-136.ec2.internal affinity1=one
